									<h2>About the Author</h2>
									<p>A Computer Engineering Student Who Managed to Survive Up to Junior Year</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hi! My name's Roujienald Aragon, but I prefer to be called "Rouj". I am a 3rd Year Computer Enginnering Student Major in System Administration
									 at the Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City. To be completely honest, I don't know about programming and coding that much,
									but I am highly interested in it, that's why I pursued this program. Overall, during my three years here I encountered many ups and downs, lying low and staying up all night,
									just to finish something.

								<p>
									Thankfully, This course has been so forgiving in its deadlines and activities. I never imagined I'll be making a website for my works. Feel free to explore around and enjoy!

										<h2>About the Website</h2>
										<p>A Compilation of His Works Throughout the Semester</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										As you may already know, this website is our final project in our course, Managing Enterprise Servers; a compilation of all our work.
										Configuring this website to my satisfaction is pretty time consuming, all the small details should be dealt with precisely, in my case.
									</p>
									<p>
										Regarding this website, I only know basic html coding, thankfully it is all set due to the template I used. This website has many pages: Home, About, Exams, Professor to keep it neat and organized.
										I did this website for the past week, to not get crammed since it's our final project.

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
										<p>Learnings and Reflections</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Throughout my experience in this course, in my professor, and in System Administration, in general, I learned a lot of valuable lessons.
										I never expected that I will enjoy this course, since I kind of chose my elective randomly. Surprisingly, I very much enjoyed the learning process.

										</p>
										<p>
										As a future System Administrator, it is crucial for me to have a basic knowledge of automation of processes, thanks for Ansible for easing things up;
										being able to automate processes saves both time and effort which in the industry also saves a lot of money. Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to our Instructor
										who is very forgiving with his deadlines and workloads. Overall, this course has been fun, and I am excited and looking forward to our next semester's elective course.
